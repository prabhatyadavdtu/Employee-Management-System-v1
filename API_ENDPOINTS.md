## üöÄ Testing with Swagger

The API includes Swagger documentation available at:
```
https://localhost:7001/swagger
```

You can:
- View all available endpoints
- Test endpoints directly from the browser
- See request/response schemas
- Authenticate using the JWT token

---

## üìã Rate Limiting

Currently, the API doesn't implement rate limiting. For production use, consider implementing:
- Request rate limiting per IP
- API key-based rate limiting
- User-based rate limiting

---

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **JWT Tokens**: Store securely, never expose in client-side code
2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated server-side
4. **SQL Injection**: Protected by Entity Framework
5. **XSS**: Input sanitization implemented
6. **CORS**: Configured for specific origins

---

## üìû Support

For API support or questions:
- Check the Swagger documentation
- Review error messages for troubleshooting
- Ensure all required fields are provided
- Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
